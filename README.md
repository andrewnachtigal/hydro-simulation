## K-Nearest Neighbors Stochastic Streamflow Simulation

### 01. River Streamflow Simulation 

Rivers provide a range of valuable societal benefits, including hydropower, flood control, irrigation, navigation and recreation. Planning and management of river systems requires an understanding of the variability of river streamflow, which are climate-dependent and vary from month to month. Modeling streamflow variability allows for the analysis of risk and uncertainty and improved hydrological management. 

Variable streamflows are usually modeled by stochastically generated sequences of synthetic streamflows, while preserving historic statistics and possibly higher order statistics. Such models assume stationary time series, that historical streamflow statistics are likely to be the same for future streamflow sequences.
